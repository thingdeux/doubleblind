### Built with Django 1.6 ###

## Summary ##
This is an unfinshed web application for sending multiple-choice anonymous messages.  This project came about during a conversation with my young niece, she lamented the fact that with all of our advances in technology there's no digital equivalent of a note from a secret admirer.  I started developing this application but overlapping work on a large Django eCommerce project from a customer took precedence.
